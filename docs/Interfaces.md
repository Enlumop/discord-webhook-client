# Interfaces

I tried to make the library as independent of itself as possible. Of course, you can use all the benefits it offers, but if for some reason you decide that you need to overwrite something, just use the appropriate interface.

The current main classes Embed, Payload and WebhookClient implement several interfaces, you will find them in [src/Interface](../src/Interface/)
